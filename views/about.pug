        .about-bio
          p As an entrepenuer with a varied experience from business ownership to customer service, I'm prepared to compliment a team of developers to build well-functioning projects to make the world a better place. With my experience in restaurants and cafes, I know what it means to be a part of a team and keep pressing on even when things are hard. I'm always interested in learning new things and refining old skills. I can't wait to meet you!
